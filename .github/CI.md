## Docker: images, dockerfiles and workflow
### Container images
oneAPI Construction Kit CI container images can be found under the [uxlfoundation repo packages tab](https://github.com/orgs/uxlfoundation/packages):
```
       ock_ubuntu_22.04-x86-64:latest
       ock_ubuntu_22.04-aarch64:latest
       ock_ubuntu_24.04-x86-64:latest
```

### Dockerfiles and container build workflow
Corresponding dockerfiles used to build the above container images can be found in the repo [dockerfile folder](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneapi-construction-kit/tree/main/.github/dockerfiles):
```
       Dockerfile_22.04-x86-64
       Dockerfile_22.04-aarch64
       Dockerfile_24.04-x86-64
```
The `publish docker images` workflow is configured to rebuild the containers when any dockerfile update is pushed to main.

## LLVM artefact management

Planned_testing workflows each use a particular llvm artefact according to llvm version, OS and architecture (e.g. llvm 20/21, Ubuntu_24, x86_64). The specific version to use and branch to reference are contained in the .yml workflow definition. llvm artefacts can be installed, built or accessed as pre-built artefacts from Github cache. They are handled as follows:
- PR testing: llvm artefact is installed as needed.
- Planned testing: a flag is set depending on whether the llvm version is stable. If the `use_llvm_github_cache` flag is set, cache is used with llvm artefact being built if required. If the flag is not set, the llvm artefact is always built.

Support for future llvm artefact versions can be added by copying the latest planned_testing workflow definition and updating the llvm variables accordingly (e.g. 21 to 22).

## Adding Self-Hosted Runners
oneAPI Construction Kit CI runs on standard Github runners. References to these runners can be replaced by references to self-hosted runners by updating individual `runs-on:` settings in the CI config to use an appropriate self-hosted runner string.

Further information on deploying self-hosted runners can be found in the [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/runners/self-hosted-runners).
Further information on `runs-on:` can also be found in the [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#jobsjob_idruns-on).

## Setting up PR testing workflow pre-requisites
A number of individual PR test jobs in the `Run ock internal tests` (PR testing) workflow include a testing phase which involves calling the `run_cities.py` script to execute a portion of the tests. This phase also requires the pre-built `opencl_cts_host_x86_64_linux` opencl_cts artifact which must be available in repo cache prior to running these tests. If this artifact is not provided in the cache the PR tests workflow will fail.

The opencl_cts artifact concerned can be built and cached by calling the `Create a cache OpenCL-CTS artifact` workflow from the web interface (i.e. via a `workflow_dispatch:` manual event trigger) in advance of running the PR tests. This workflow can be called in forks.
There are a number of inputs to this workflow which relate to Git checkout references in OpenCL repos. The default values for these can be found in [the workflow](workflows/create_opencl_cts_artefact.yml).
These default values can also be set interactively on a per-run basis when called from the web interface. 

At the point at which an update to the opencl_cts cache artifact is required (e.g. when new Git checkout references are available and the workflow inputs default values shown above have been updated accordingly) the existing artifact should be manually deleted prior to re-running the artefact creation workflow. The update workflow will fail if an existing cached artifact is found. Consideration should be given to avoid impacting any in-progress PRs referencing the previous opencl_cts cache artefact version.

## Running planned_testing workflows
### Manually tailoring planned_testing workflows for a specific DPC++ PR
Planned_testing workflows are configured to run via `workflow_dispatch:` (manual event trigger). Included in this process is the ability to specify a particular DPC++ repo PR number as a per-run parameter. The number is converted into a repo reference representing a merge of the given PR into the default branch. If it is not specified the default DPC++ branch itself will be used as the reference.

### Further tailoring of planned_testing workflows
The following planned_testing workflows call `Run planned testing` (planned_testing_caller.yml) as a sub-workflow:
```
      run planned tests for llvm 20: planned_testing_caller_20.yml
      run planned tests for llvm 21: planned_testing_caller_21.yml
```
These workflows can be tailored to run specific llvm versions (e.g. 20), target lists (e.g. host_x86_64_linux) and test options (e.g. test_sanitizers), etc., by setting the scripted `inputs:` values to `Run planned testing` accordingly. See the planned_testing workflow .yml files for examples of current default values and tailoring options. With the exception of DPC++ PRs (see above) tailored values can only be set directly in workflow config and cannot currently be updated interactively on a per-run basis when called from the web interface (i.e. `workflow_dispatch:`).

### Planned_testing workflows in forks
Planned_testing workflows can also be run via `workflow_dispatch:` (manual event trigger) in forks. Examples can be found [in this fork](https://github.com/AERO-Project-EU/oneapi-construction-kit/actions?query=event%3Aworkflow_dispatch).
