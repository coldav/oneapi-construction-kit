# Abstract

This RFC provides a boilerplate or sample template for creating your own
Markdown RFCs. In conjunction with the content guidelines in
[RFC 1][rfc-0001], this should make it easy for you to conform your own RFCs
to the format outlined below.

Note: if you are reading this RFC via the web, you should first grab the textr
(Markdown) source of this RFC in order to complete the steps below. DO NOT USE
 THE HTML FILE AS YOUR TEMPLATE!

The source for this (or any) RFC can be found in the [`rfcs` branch of the
oneAPI Construction Kit repository][ock-rfcs].

# Rationale

If you intend to submit a RFC, you MUST use this template, in conjunction with
the format guidelines below, to ensure that your RFC submission won't get
 automatically rejected because of form.

Markdown provides PEP authors with useful functionality and expressivity, while
maintaining easy readability in the source text. The processed HTML form makes
the functionality accessible to readers: live hyperlinks, styled text, tables,
images, and automatic tables of contents, among other advantages.

# How to Use This Template

- Make a copy of [`rfc-0002/rfc-NNNN.md`][rfc-nnnn] (the `.md` file, **not** the
  HTML!) and perform the following edits. Name the new file `rfc-NNNN.md`, using
  the next available number (not used by a published or in-PR RFC).
- Replace the "rfc" header with "rfc: NNNN", matching the file name. Note that
  the file name should be padded with zeros (eg `rfc-0002.md`), but the header
  should not (`rfc: 2`).
- Change the title header to the title of your RFC.
- Change the author header to include your name, and optionally your email
  address. Be sure to follow the format carefully: your name must appear first,
  and it must not be contained in parentheses. Your email address may appear
  second (or it can be omitted) and if it appears, it must appear in angle
  brackets. It is okay to obfuscate your email address.
- If none of the authors are core developers, include a Sponsor header with the
  name of the core developer sponsoring your RFC.
- Add the direct URL of the RFC's canonical discussion thread (on e.g. GitHub
  Discussions) under the discussions-to header. If the thread will be created
  after the RFC is submitted as an official draft, it is okay to just list the
  venue name initially, but remember to update the RFC with the URL as soon as
  the RFC is successfully merged to the `rfcs` branch and you create the
  corresponding discussion thread. See [RFC 1][rfc-0001] for more details.
- Change the status header to "draft".
- Now write your Abstract, Rationale, and other content for your RFC, replacing
  placeholders with your own text.
- Update your Footnotes section, listing any footnotes and non-inline link
  targets referenced by the text.
- Create a pull request against the [`rfcs` branch][ock-rfcs].
