[NATIVE_CPU][SYCL] Update CMakes to be more LLVM like and update directory structure

Move directory structure of files required for native cpu into appropriate
directory structure under lvm/lib/SYCLNativeCPUUtils.

This also updates the CMakeLists.txt to be appropriate for llvm components,
rather in the style of oneAPI Construction Kit.
