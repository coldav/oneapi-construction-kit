# Abstract

Vulkan API is incomplete and requires installing Vulkan SDK, as well as being
enabled by default. It has a maintenance and design overhead and is not being
used, as well as leading to customer confusion. It is proposed that it should be
removed in its entirety.

# Motivation

Support for Vulkan is incomplete and cannot be used for full Vulkan support. It
is not being used anywhere at present and leads to requirement on installing the
Vulkan SDK in order to build OCK. This is also enabled by default and has led to
confusion among users of OCK, particularly in the requirements for building. It
can lead to additional requirements on the main part of OCK, such as descriptor
binding lists.

# Rationale

By removing it altogether this avoids any confusion on the part of the user and
reduces the maintenance overhead.

# Specification

Remove everything under source/vk and from all documentation that refers to it,
as well as any github workflow or docker requirements such as installing the
vulkan SDK. Anything that exists purely for the sake of Vulkan should also be
removed, such as the descriptor binding lists. This can be analyzed by reviewing
the removed Vulkan code for dependencies. This should also be reflected in the
CHANGELOG.md file ready for the release notes.

There will be no references to the Vulkan API or connected code beyond 4.0.0,
beyond what is needed for release notes.

# Backwards Compatibility

Since the Vulkan API will no longer be supported, there will be no backward
compatibility in this regard. Codeplay will no longer provide support for Vulkan
API for any versions. Users may fork from 4.0.0 and fix any issues themselves if
they wish to use the Vulkan API.

The default build will still work for the OpenCL API, so current customers are
unlikely to be affected.

# Security Implications

None

# How to Teach This

This should be added to the next release notes.

# Reference Implementation

The reference implementation is
[here](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneapi-construction-kit/pull/648). Note
this makes the majority of the changes necessary, but is not complete and there
are some TODOs to check.

# Rejected Ideas

We could keep it as is but have it disabled by default and only test it in our
nightly testing. Although this has its merits, the author feels that Vulkan is
of little benefit as is and we would get an overall lowering of our maintenance
by dropping it altogether. Having something but not testing it leads to bitrot
and inability to know whether a change breaks anything.
